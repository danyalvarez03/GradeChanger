      File:  GradeChanger.java

      Programmer:  Daniel A. Alvarez

      Purpose:  Enable the user to replace a studentâ€™s given grade in a course with a new one, 
                to add a new course grade, and to compute the GPA.

      I affirm that this class is entirely my own work and none of it is the work of anyone else.
